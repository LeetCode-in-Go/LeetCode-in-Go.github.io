## 86\. Partition List

Medium

Given the `head` of a linked list and a value `x`, partition it such that all nodes **less than** `x` come before nodes **greater than or equal** to `x`.

You should **preserve** the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/partition.jpg)

**Input:** head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3

**Output:** [1,2,2,4,3,5]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [2,1], x = 2

**Output:** [1,2]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 200]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `-200 <= x <= 200`

## Solution

```golang
type ListNode struct {
	Val  int
	Next *ListNode
}
```
